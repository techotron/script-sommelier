    For this script I'd recommend a light, crisp white wine, just to start the inital runtime off.
    Perhaps an Albarino from Northern spain or an Argentinian Torrontes?
    But if you're feeling like pushing the boat out, why not choose my favourite, the Pouilly-Fuisse Terres de Pierres which, with it's terrific minerality and fruit intensity will certainly soften the exceptions as they inevitably arrise in your terrible code.

    This script is packed with complex functions and advanced methods so it would be best suited with a red but looking for some medium bodied to help bring out the novice techniques.
    Perhaps the Ursa Maior Rioja Reserva 2005 or, for even more intense fruit, try the 2010 Tour de Belfort.
    Gently pour the wine into a good sized claret glass, taking care to avoid disturbing the sediment. Take a moment to enjoy the nose and it's into the script IDE and you're good to go.

    As we cast our eyes over this script, I'm recommending something a little sweeter, to soften the blow of the headache that will inevitably ensue.
    How about the 2005 Chateau Sauterne, which has Apricot and Honeycomb notes which will really compliment the whitespace and style conflicts which are peppered into the code.
    But for those of you who enjoy masochism, you really can't do better than a 2007 Paul Cluver Noble Late Harvest Riesling, from the apple growing area of Elgan on the western cape.
    Enjoy.

    It's probably been a long day already for you, so I'm now suggesting a digestif.
    Oh and by the way, I'd hate you to think you have to drink alcohol whilst writing your scripts...I just think you'd enjoy your day even more if you do.
    Why not round off the confusing logic and inefficient workflows with a Noval 20 year old Tawny Port. Wonderfully mellow with toffee, brazils and hazlenuts that linger forever.
    Or alternatively a 10 year old Cider Brandy from Somerset, the friendly cousin of Calvados. Or even a generous, peaty slug of Caol Ila Single Malt. That should see you through.

    Hhmm. I'm struggling to find a complimentary with this one.
    Wait...was this written by Colin Nash or Pete Whitehead?
    3 litres of White Lightening.
