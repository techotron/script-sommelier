    For this script I'd recommend a light, crisp white wine, just to start the inital runtime off.
    Perhaps an Albarino from Northern spain or an Argentinian Torrontes?
    But if you're feeling like pushing the boat out, why not choose my favourite, the Pouilly-Fuisse Terres de Pierres which, with it's terrific minerality and fruit intensity will certainly soften the exceptions as they inevitably arrise in your terrible code.
